// Intro ✔
- Me in front of camera intro
- Intro of google earth flying up to title "Keadaan Internet: Sistem Terpusat vs Terdesentralisasi"
- Background of earth spinning and a node graph representing a network

// Survey data ✔
- Pie chart of how much knows centralized or decentralized is
- Knowledge vs Care graph

// Transition to explanation ✔
- Big moving network of nodes
- Trimming the network to show a small network

// Centralized explanation ✔
- Morphing a center node into a square (server)
- 1s and 0s in the server square
- Nodes transferring data from and to the server

// Decentralized explanation ✔
- Add more nodes and turn more nodes into servers
- Nodes transferring data through a lot of servers

// Examples ✔
- Centralized and Decentralized side by side in boxes 
- List under the boxes

// More survey data ✔
- Bar graph of 1 through 5
- Lock in front of something to represent data in 1 side
- No crime sign in 5 side
- Possible represent contoh masalah
- Balance scale

// Current Internet ✔
- Starting with decentralized graph
- Add a bunch of nodes and servers
- Divide servers to data centers
- Data, divide data, data move through nodes using different paths
- Logos of big companies behind data centers

// Future of the Internet ✔
- Peer to peer 
- Data based on color found with location on left
- Data based on color found with color
- Ledger on the left then share copies throughout the nodes

// Credits ✔
- My face recording on the left
- Credits roll on the right: Mr Eka, 83 respondents, manim, any other resources I used

WHAT I NEED THE NODES TO BE ABLE TO DO

- Set X and Y of node ✔
- Show an ellipse on the screen ✔
- Morph ellipse into square ✔
- Connect nodes with edges ✔
- Edges pulse with color when transferring data ✔
- Divide squares into nine smaller squares ✔
- Move the nodes around ✔
